# YOLOv4-to-CoreML

1. Train your YOLOv4 model from [Darknet](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet)
2. Convert YOLOv4 darknet model to tensorflow/keras model from
- IOS version before 15 [hunglc007/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite](https://github.com/hunglc007/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite)
- IOS version from 15 [doduy/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite](https://github.com/DoDuy/YOLOv4-to-CoreML/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite)
3. Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Convert YOLOv4-tiny tensorflow/keras model to coreml model
